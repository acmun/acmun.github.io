            <p>

                The word "Crisis" may just be an overused word taken as an excuse to categorize almost every global and
                national risk, threat or potential threats rising but in the case of Pakistan (one of the most important
                strategically placed countries in the world) it is a mere definition of the fragile and magnanimously
                complex current state. Even for a lay man interested only in the loaf of bread that this country
                provides to him the plethora of real crisis jumbles up to become a list of challenges defining the
                future of his state; the constant deterioration in relations with Afghanistan in the North, fear of
                possible annexation and independence of Baluchistan sharing its borders with hostile Afghans, the
                potential threats of large influx of RAW agents from the Indian Border and Indian Agency in Kandahar,
                the growing Chinese influence through uncontrolled means of alliance in the form of Gwadar Sea Port and
                the Karakoram Highway, and the ever tense situation in Indian held and Azad Jammu Kashmir to sum it all
                up. These growing national issues place a country (that is so important to the most prominent ones in
                the world due to its strong military serving as possibly the worldâs most effective tool against the
                Taliban, its heavy nuclear arsenal placed in the middle of a country placed so close to the main ISIS
                centers and the fact that Pakistan serves as the Islamic Hub of the 67 Muslim countries sharing close
                relations with the dipoles of modern Islamic power; Saudi Arabia and Iran) in a task that is
                ever-growing in its difficulty facing a Pakistan weakened in every aspect except for its military power
                over the last 67 years of its founding. Despite these external challenges the internal ones always find
                a way to seep into the Pakistani News everyday clearly highlighting themselves as more important.
                Islamic Fundamentalism: The US and west view Islamic fundamentalism as a threat to its new hegemonic
                power. This is a self-created and self-motivated concept of West particular in the context of Muslim
                world. Suicide bombing, killing, terrorist attack and extremist has been present in every society since
                past and is present in every corner of the world. History of the world is full of many incidents and
                personalities who are involved in terrorist and extremists activities and did not belong to Islamic
                Society. Mostly persons blamed in recent extremist activities are those which belong to Muslim community
                but they are brought up in Western societies. We need to wash away the title of extremist from our faces
                while dealing in the comity of nations. Through our foreign policy we need to present a picture that we
                are a responsible and moderate Muslim country. Some fraction of society opposed president Musharrafâs
                cooperation with Washington and the US presence in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This led some radical
                Muslim to call for Musharrafâs assassination and an Islamic revolution in Pakistan. Benazirâs
                assassination is also an episode of the same serial. These events lead towards the tarnishing image of
                Pakistan and portray like a rogue state, a supporter of terrorism that already possessed weapons of man
                destruction. Prevention of another India- Pakistan war, wider strategic cooperation and stronger
                economic ties with US, Pakistanâs identity as a moderate Muslim state is challenges faced by Pakistani
                government on foreign policy front in new millennium. In addition to this, Pakistan continues to face
                tremendous pressure from western media, which critically examine the imagined links between Al-Qaeda and
                Pakistan. American media in particular tried to label Pakistani intelligentsia, intelligence agencies
                and nuclear scientists, collaborating and assisting to develop âdirty bombâ. Pakistani scientist has
                also been labeled as fundamentalist. Lose Angels Times even declared Abdul Qadeer Khan âThe man that
                could be called the Axis of Evilâ expressing concern and suspicion regarding the link of Pakistanâs
                nuclear program with some of the Islamic countries9. This is the biggest challenge of the time
                particularly in the environment where suicide bombing and killing of innocent human being have become
                the music of the day and major challenge in Pakistan. Drone attacks: US forces launched drone attacks on
                different villages of Bajour agency and other part of Waziristan and adjacent tribal areas. This area
                falls under the administrative control of Pakistan. Pakistanâs territorial sovereignty has been violated
                by the US forces on the pretext of hot pursuit of Al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants and the causalities and
                death toll of civilians are rising day by day on the name of collateral damage. There has been strong
                public reaction in Pakistan against the recent US drone attack in Northern part of Pakistan which
                resulted in the killing of hundreds of people, including women and children. It is a flagrant violation
                of Pakistan sovereignty according to the norms of international law. People are of the opinion that any
                action against Al-Qaeda on Pakistani soil should be taken by the Pakistani authorities not by American
                forces or at least Pakistani authorities should be informed prior to any action. The response of
                Pakistani government in this matter has been inadequate and it is quite alarming to note that Washington
                does not care about tendering an apology for the blatant violation of Pakistanâs sovereignty and lose of
                human lives instead Washington has defended its action on grounds of tracking down terrorist. These
                attacks are an eye opener for Pakistani government. It shows that government is proved as a failure in
                providing sovereignty to its citizens and territory and US announced that they will take such actions in
                futures if there is necessity. Public anger in Pakistan against both the US and the present government
                on this issue is mounting up as these unacceptable acts are questioning our national dignity and
                security. Balochistan issue: Balochistan has assumed a serious dimension particularly in the post Gwadar
                Scenario. Akbar Bugtiâs assassination, mineral resources, reservoirs of natural gas and coal are the
                vital issues which caused feeling of discrimination among people of the area. External factors like
                India and Iran are reported to be further aggravating the situation. Since the US invasion over
                Afghanistan, Balochistan is tending to acquire importance in the American policy of South Asia.
                Balochistan enjoys extraordinary geostrategic importance since it is the hub between South Asia, West
                Asia and Central Asia. Another aspect of Balochistanâs strategic importance to the US is the role of
                China in deep sea Gwadar Port. American are so concern on this internal matter of security of Pakistan
                that a Republican congressman, Thomas Tancredo in a letter sent to former US Secretary of State
                Condoleezza Rice wrote. âIt is my understanding that president Bush will be traveling to Pakistan in
                March 2006. Please urge him to raise the issue of Balochistan with president Musharraf so this dispute
                may come to conclusion and further losses of life may be prevented Mr. Tancredo claims that the
                operation in Balochistan divert important military resources that could be used to hunt Al- Qaeda and
                other terrorist groups10. In actual, White House wants to delineate Chinese influence in the region by
                controlling the geostrategic location of Balochistan to access Central Asian states. It is also worthy
                to note that the forces of nationalism in Baluchistan are threats to national integration and
                federation. Nuclear Proliferation issue It has been rightly stated by Margaret Thatcher that huffing and
                puffing about test bans and non-proliferation did not stop India and Pakistan and is not going to stop
                major states from getting nuclear weapon when their security interest19. IAEA pointed towards Pakistan
                for proliferating WMDs and no Muslim country supported us. It does mean that we should not delink
                ourselves from OIC but we should first seek our own national interest than we should look towards Umah.
                It is further alleged that Pakistanâs nuclearization has contributed to international terrorism. The US
                expressed serious concern regarding the authenticity
                of the control and command system and Pakistanâs ability to protect its nuclear assets. Daily Dawn
                reported the arrival of arms control Scientists in Islamabad to assess the foolproof measures for the
                protection and safety of nuclear installations. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan is also a victim of the same
                allegation that he has been involved in transferring the nuclear technology to Iran and North Korea.
                Kashmir issue: William E. Brown and Robert Windrem in their controversial book âCritical Massâ had
                maintained that because of the Kashmir issue south Asia is the most dangerous place on the earth20.
                Kashmir has always been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan for the last 63 years. Religious
                and emotional attachment of people of Pakistan with Kashmir always pursues the policy makers to take
                tough and non-flexible stance over Kashmir issue. On the other hand Kashmiris are angry on Pakistanâs
                policy towards Kashmir because they have not rendered scarifies of their lives merely for the sake of a
                bus service, ferry service, train service, self-governance and option like a âunited states of Kashmir.â
                But clearly their goal is Islam and Pakistan for which they are offering the precious sacrifice of their
                lives. The reliability on UN has so far yielded benefits equal to nil and the task is on Pakistan's
                shoulders itself for the Pakistan National Assembly to step up and curb these internal threats with
                honor, nationalistic integrity, self-correction and above all force that has been missing for quite a
                lot of time now.
