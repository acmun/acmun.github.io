                This isn't going to be your typical committee. You're going to have to be dynamic, influential, and above all, innovative. The criteria for excellence in this committee isn't going to be your solely your research, or your speeches, or simply the quality of your written material. It will be the overall impact you have on the people around you, the extent to which you can persuade others to accept your point of view, the power and impact of your speeches, especially political rhetoric(because I've always found a barrage of statistics and facts a good way to put myself to sleep). We'll be looking for all of these things while deciding that elusive best delegate award. That said, best of luck come September.

                <br><br>
                My name is Bilal Shafi Sheikh, in case the caption below that picture has not already told you, 
                And I shall be absolutely DELIGHTED (not) to be chairing the Special Political and Decolonization Committee this year at the 6th edition of the Aitchison College Model United Nations. 
                <br><br>
                First, the MUNs. I have been a very active member of the ACMUN society for the past 4 years. So rest assured, you are in safe hands (or not, people usually get hurt around me). Come this September, I look forward to a very well researched committee familiar with all the subtle nuances of diplomacy; BUT more than anything else, I expect an extremely intellectually stimulating debate. I want all of my delegates to be excellent speakers, skilled with rhetoric, able to think on their feet, armed with sharp one liners to drive their points home. Those two words really are key to any competent committee in any MUN: diplomacy, and debate. Do note however that I am extremely opposed to the idea of ‘dirty diplomacy’ and underhand tactics shall not win you any favours from me. However, even during the throes of the committee session, I earnestly urge you to not get too caught up with the trivialities of an MUN and keep the spirit of learning and fun alive. Do your best to win the coveted Best Delegate award, and do your best to enjoy every second of ACMUN VI which I hope proves to be an unforgettable experience for you while you make life-long friends. 
                <br><br>
                Second, ME (yes I’m very narcissistic). I have a tendency to come off as very emotionally volatile. So do bear with me if I’m crooning one second and ranting the next. Apparently (according to biased third party sources), I’m a drama queen too. My fellow secretariat members can also testify to the fact that I get off at annoying the hell out of everyone present in the room. Moreover, I play tennis and I happen to be a HUGE Federer fan, so brownie points to you if you think Federer is GOAT (or even know what GOAT stands for). I also happen to love free food (hint hint). 
                <br><br>
                What else do I get off at? Ah yes, coffee, cookies, Literature, heavy metal, cookies, Pearl Jam, Iron Maiden, senti music, Lord of the Rings, cookies, fiction, physics, cookies, chocolate, cookies…. 
                <br><br>
                Notice that I love my cookies? Take them from me and I shall annihilate you, in the most imaginative, painful way possible. 
                <br><br>
                On that happy note, do contact me at bssheikh99@gmail.com, if you have any further enquiries. During committee session I shall also be more than willing to help you with our competent dais consisting of my committee director, Hamis Mehmood and my ACDs, Shahzeb Amin and Syed Rafay Hassan. 
                <br><br>
                Good luck, Godspeed and see you this fall!!!
